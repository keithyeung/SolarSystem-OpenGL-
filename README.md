# SolarSystem-OpenGL-
attempt to create SolarSystem with OpenGL &amp; GLSL

This is an University Assignment that I tried to implement Solar System with OpenGL & GLSL. Most of the code for setting up OpenGL was NOT created and implemented by me. Our lecturer basically created a little engine for us to learn OpenGL & GLSL. He go through the process of setting up OpenGL with us but it was very hard to follow because It's the first time I get to learn anything for graphics programming.

I've only worked on 
application.hpp   /  application.cpp 
planet.hpp        /  planet.cpp
world.fs.glsl     /  world.vs.glsl

Therefore I will only upload these files.
